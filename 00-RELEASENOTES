Redis Community Edition 8.0 release notes
=========================================

============================================================
8.0-M03 (v7.9.226)    Committed Mon 20 Jan 2025 15:00:00 IST
============================================================

This is the third Milestone of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Milestones are non-feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.
Once we reach feature-completeness we will release RC1.

### Headlines:

8.0-M03 introduces an improved replication mechanism which is more performant and robust, a new I/O threading implementation which enables throughput increase on multi-core environments, and many additional performance improvements. Both Alpine and Debian Docker images are now available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). A snap and Homebrew distributions are available as well.


### Security fixes

- (CVE-2024-46981) Lua script may lead to remote code execution
- (CVE-2024-51741) Denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors

### New Features

- #13695 New I/O threading implementation 
- #13732 New replication mechanism


### Bug fixes

- #13653 `MODULE LOADEX` - crash on nonexistent parameter name
- #13661 `FUNCTION FLUSH` - memory leak when using jemalloc
- #13626 Memory leak on failed RDB loading

### Other general improvements

- #13639 When `hide-user-data-from-log` is enabled - also print command tokens on crash
- #13660 Add the Lua VM memory to memory overhead

### New metrics

- #13592 `INFO` - new `KEYSIZES` section includes key size distributions for basic data types
- #13695 `INFO` - new `Threads` section includes I/O threading metrics

### Modules API

- #13666 `RedisModule_ACLCheckKeyPrefixPermissions` - check access permissions to any key matching a given prefix
- #13676 `RedisModule_HashFieldMinExpire` - query the minimum expiration time over all the hashâ€™s fields

============================================================

This is the second Milestone of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Milestones are non-feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.
