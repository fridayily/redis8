============================================================

This is the first Release Candidate of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Release candidates are feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.

### Headlines

8.0-RC1 includes 3 new hash commands, performance improvements, and memory defragmentation improvements.

### Distributions

8.0-M03 (v7.9.226)    Committed Mon 20 Jan 2025 15:00:00 IST
============================================================

This is the third Milestone of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Milestones are non-feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.
Once we reach feature-completeness we will release RC1.

### Headlines:

8.0-M03 introduces an improved replication mechanism which is more performant and robust, a new I/O threading implementation which enables throughput increase on multi-core environments, and many additional performance improvements. Both Alpine and Debian Docker images are now available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). A snap and Homebrew distributions are available as well.


### Security fixes

- (CVE-2024-46981) Lua script may lead to remote code execution
- (CVE-2024-51741) Denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors

### New Features

### New metrics

- #13592 `INFO` - new `KEYSIZES` section includes key size distributions for basic data types
